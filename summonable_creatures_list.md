**Note:** Spells like `Conjure Fey`, `Summon Greater Demon`, etc., which summon creatures based on a CR range without providing a specific list, are omitted for now due to the large number of potential creatures. The newer "Summon [Creature Type]" spells from Tasha's Cauldron of Everything are also not included, as they summon a unique stat block defined in the spell description rather than an existing monster.
