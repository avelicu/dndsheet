## Notes:

- For spells with static stat blocks (Summon Beast, Summon Fey, etc.), the CR is fixed based on spell level and doesn't require filtering
- For spells with variable CR (Conjure Animals, Conjure Minor Elementals, etc.), users need to filter by creature type and CR range
- Many spells scale with higher level spell slots (both CR and count)
- Some spells have random results (Summon Lesser Demons rolls d6)

## Recommended UI Approach:

**For variable-CR spells (Conjure Animals, etc.):**
- Preset buttons like "Filter for Conjure Animals: Eight CR ≤ 1/4 beasts"
- This sets type=Beast, maxCR=0.25
- User can adjust CR range for higher level slots

**For fixed stat block spells (Summon Beast, etc.):**
- Don't need creature filtering - they use fixed stat blocks
- Could add a note: "This spell doesn't summon generic creatures"
